# To-do-list
It's a training project. it's to-do list app. In it, you can add new things, edit, delete things and mark things as completed. You have opportunity to add a thing for today, for the future or without a date.

The app is still being developed.

I want to add work with data, becouse it's not working quite right now. Add the ability to receive notifications about the transfer of outstanding tasks for today to other days. And make the list with all things structured by section to differentiate things with different dates and without dates for ease of use.
